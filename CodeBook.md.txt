1. We have to download the data from the link below. Since the data are zipped we need to unzip to working directory inorder to work on the R studio
2. We have to perform the R script

About source of the data
The source of the data was used from Human Acitivity Recognition Using Smartphones Data set. A full description is available at the mentioned sites below.
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The below link provides data for the project.
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


1. Merging the "training" and the "test" data sets to create combined data set.
# Reading training data 
# Reading testing data
# Reading features vector
# Reading activity label
# Assigning column names
# Merging all datas into one large set
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements
# Reading column names
# Creating a vector defining ID, Mean and Standard deviation
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the actiivity in the data set
# Subsetting Means and Standard deviation
4. To label the data set with descriptive variable names

5. Creating a second independeent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
# Making second tidy data set
# Writing second tidy data in text file

About the variables:
a. x_train, y_train, x_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded zip files after unzipping the files.
b. x_data, y_data and the subject_data merge with the previous datasets for the analysis
c. features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset which are applied ot the column names
